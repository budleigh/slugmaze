# Slugmaze: A Visual Memory Game #

## You have awoken alone in a pitch black maze. You are also a slug. ##

## Summary ##
  Using Slugmaze, you can practice your short-term visual-spatial memory in the
  playful yet exhilarating context of a struggle against the
  unwavering ineffable gods. They will show you the way, and you must
  follow their instructions, or face certain death. Have fun!

## Instructions and Tutorial ##
  * Visualize the Path in your mind's eye, and hold it there while the Path
    disappears. It will not reappear, despite your protests. The Path
    can hear you, but the Path does not deign to listen. It is the one true Path.
    To stray from the Path is to commit an act against nature, and such an act
    will be punished accordingly.

  * The Maze may decide to transform itself. If this happens you must respect its
    wishes, for the Path is bound to the Maze by something
    [greater than ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation).
    If you have visualized the Path, this is of no consequence. The Path
    does not change; only your perception changes.

  * The Path is unknowable. The Maze is unbeatable. The Game, as life,
    is unwinnable. There is no escape. There is no victory. There is only the
    sweet embrace of death and darkness.

  * Use the arrow keys to move.

## Testimonial ##
  A slug was shown a Path. The Path rotated beneath him. Since the slug was
  itself a part of the Path, it too rotated. Thus, the Path did not change.

  At that moment, the slug was enlightened.
