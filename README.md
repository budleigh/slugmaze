# Slugmaze: A Visual Memory Game #

## You have awoken alone in a pitch black maze. You are also a slug. ##

## Summary ##
  Using Slugmaze, you can practice your short-term visual-spatial memory in the
  playful yet exhilarating context of a life-or-death struggle against the
  unwavering ineffable gods. They will show you the way, and your job
  is to reproduce their instructions, or face certain death. Have fun!

## Instructions and Tutorial ##
  * Visualize the Path in your deepest inner self, and hold it there for
  all eternity. It will not reappear before you, despite your protests. The Path
  can hear you, but the Path does not care. It is the one true Path. To stray
  from the Path is an act against nature itself, and will be punished accordingly.

  * The Maze may decide to transform itself. If this happens you must respect its
  wishes, for the Path is bound to the Maze by something
  [greater than ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation).
  If you have visualized the Path, this is of no consequence. The Path
  does not change; only your perception changes.

  * The Path is unknowable. The Maze is unbeatable. The Game, like life itself,
    is unwinnable. There is no escape. There is no victory. There is only the
    sweet embrace of death.

  * Use the arrow keys to move.

## Testimonial ##
  A slug was shown a Path. The Path rotated beneath him. Since the slug was
  itself a part of the Path, it too rotated. Thus, the Path did not change. At
  that moment, the slug was enlightened.
