# Slugmaze: A Visual Memory Game #

## You have awoken alone in a pitch black maze. You are also a slug. ##

## Summary ##
  Using Slugmaze, you can practice your short-term visual-spatial memory in the
  playful yet exhilarating context of a life-or-death struggle against the
  unwavering ineffable gods. They will show you the way, and your job
  is to reproduce their instructions, or face certain death. Have fun!

## Testimonial ##
  A slug was shown a Path. The Path rotated beneath him. Since the slug was
  itself a part of the Path, it too rotated. Thus, the Path did not change. At
  that moment, the slug was enlightened.

## Instructions and Tutorial ##
  * Internalize the briefly shown Path in your deepest inner self, for the
  remainder of eternity. It will not reappear, despite your protests. It is the
  one true Path. To stray from the Path is an act against nature itself, and
  will be punished accordingly.

  * The Maze may decide to transform itself. If this happens you must respect its
  wishes, for the Path is bound to the Maze by something
  [greater than ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation).
  Since you already internalized the Path, this is of no consequence.

  * The Maze is unbeatable. The Path is unknowable. The Game, like life itself,
    is unwinnable. There is no escape. There is no victory. There is only the
    sweet embrace of death.

  * Use the arrow keys to move.
