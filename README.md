# Slugmaze: A Visual Memory Game #

You have awoken alone in a pitch black maze. A light appears in front of you,
leading the way forward. Also, you are a slug.

## Summary ##
  Using Slugmaze, you can practice your short-term visual-spatial memory in the
  playful yet exhilarating context of a struggle against the
  unwavering ineffable gods. They will show you the way, and you must
  follow their instructions, or face certain death. Have fun!

## Instructions and Tutorial ##
  * Visualize the Path in your mind's eye, and hold it there while the Path
    disappears. It will not reappear, despite your protests. The Path
    can hear you, but the Path does not deign to listen. It is the one true Path.
    To stray from the Path is to commit an act against nature, and such an act
    will be punished accordingly.

  * The Maze will transform itself. When this happens you must honor its
    transformation, for the Path is bound to the Maze by something
    [greater than ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation).
    If you have visualized the Path, this is of no consequence. The Path
    does not change; only your perception of the Path changes.

  * The Path is unknowable. The Maze is unbeatable. The Game, as with life,
    is unwinnable. There is no escape. There is no victory. There is only the
    empty void; the sweet embrace of death.

  * Use the arrow keys to move.

## Testimonial ##
  A master and her student were shown a Path. The Path rotated beneath them.
  The student stood still and watched as the master turned as one with the Path.

  "Why do you move with the Path while it changes," asked the student.

  "I have not moved, " said the master. "The Path has not changed."

  At that moment, the student was enlightened.
